# Optimization-Related Packages
The ecosystem of [Julia packages](http://pkg.julialang.org) is growing very fast. There are JuliaOpt packages that are not introduced in the [home](/) page and other optimization related packages that are not part of JuliaOpt.


## JuMP Extensions

- [JuMPeR.jl](https://github.com/IainNZ/JuMPeR.jl): for robust optimization

- [MultiJuMP.jl](https://github.com/anriseth/MultiJuMP.jl): for multi-objective optimization

- [JuMPChance.jl](https://github.com/mlubin/JuMPChance.jl): for probabilistic chance constraints.

- [StochDynamicProgramming.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/StochDynamicProgramming.jl): for discrete-time stochastic optimal control problems.

## Other Optimization

- [JuliaSmoothOptimizers](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers): A collection of tools primarily designed for developing solvers for smooth nonlinear optimization.

- [NEOS.jl](https://github.com/odow/NEOS.jl): an interface to the [NEOS Optimization Server](http://www.neos-server.org/).

- [BlackBoxOptim.jl](https://github.com/robertfeldt/BlackBoxOptim.jl): a derivative-free, global optimizer that supports multi-objective optimization problems

- [Pajarito](https://github.com/mlubin/Pajarito.jl) - A state-of-the-art solver for mixed-integer convex optimization written in Julia.
