# What is Julia?
["Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing"](http://julialang.org). It is free (open source) and supports Windows, OSX, and Linux. It has a familiar syntax, works well with external libraries, is fast, and has advanced language features like metaprogramming that enable interesting possibilities for optimization software.

# What is JuliaOpt?
The [JuliaOpt GitHub organization](https://github.com/JuliaOpt) is home to a number of optimization-related packages written in Julia. Its purpose is to facilitate collaboration among developers of a tightly integrated set of packages for mathematical optimization.

- **Overview**: [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LNeR299q88) and [workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnL7yLMVu6c) from JuliaCon 2015
- **JuMP-dev Workshops**: [2019](meetings/santiago2019/), [2018](meetings/bordeaux2018/), [2017](meetings/mit2017/)
- **Code**: [github.com/JuliaOpt](http://github.com/JuliaOpt)
- **Forum**: [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/opt)
- **Old Mailing list**: [julia-opt](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/julia-opt)
