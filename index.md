title:  JuliaOpt&#58; Optimization packages for the Julia language
---

# What is Julia?
[Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing"](http://julialang.org). It is free (open source) and supports Windows, OSX, and Linux. It has a familiar syntax, works well with external libraries, is fast, and has advanced language features like metaprogramming that enable interesting possibilities for optimization software.


# What is JuliaOpt?
JuliaOpt is an organization that brings together packages written in Julia that are related to optimization. All JuliaOpt packages should be high-quality, documented, tested, support the main operating systems, and interact with each other.
