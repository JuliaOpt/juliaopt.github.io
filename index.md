# What is Julia?
["Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing"](http://julialang.org). It is free (open source) and supports Windows, OSX, and Linux. It has a familiar syntax, works well with external libraries, is fast, and has advanced language features like metaprogramming that enable interesting possibilities for optimization software.

# What is JuliaOpt?
The [JuliaOpt GitHub organization](https://github.com/JuliaOpt) is home to a number of optimization-related packages written in Julia. Its purpose is to facilitate collaboration among developers of a tightly integrated set of packages for mathematical optimization.
