# The Second Annual JuMP-dev Workshop

June 27-29, 2018, at the Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux, University of Bordeaux.

## Purpose

This workshop is a follow-up to the [first annual JuMP-dev workshop](/meetings/mit2017/) held in June 2017 at MIT. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together students, researchers, and practitioners with interests in the software aspects of [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) and related packages. Interest areas of the workshop include:

- JuMP core development ([MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl), JuMP 1.0)
- Mathematical optimization solvers written in Julia
- Automatic differentiation in Julia (ReverseDiffSparse, ...)
- Julia interfaces to solvers
- JuMP extensions (stochastic programming, robust optimization, multiobjective optimization, ...)
- Optimization libraries that use JuMP
- Significant uses of JuMP in applications
- JuMP for teaching
- Developer tools for JuMP

The JuMP-dev workshop is a great opportunity to meet other people working on and around JuMP, as well as to provide feedback to the core JuMP team concerning its future direction. The workshop is scheduled to lead into [ISMP](https://ismp2018.sciencesconf.org).

## Location

The workshop will be held at the Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux, University of Bordeaux.

A variety of information about Bordeaux, as well as how to get there, and possible accommodation options, is available on the [ISMP conference website](https://ismp2018.sciencesconf.org).

## Call for participants and talks

The workshop is open for anybody to attend. In particular, we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core development team.

Participants are encouraged to give a short (~20-minute) talk. The committee is looking for talks that will start off discussions during the workshop and beyond and for talks that present developments that the community may not be aware of. Talks will optionally be recorded and posted for those who cannot attend. We encourage speakers to give direct feedback on JuMP. See [last year's talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esOe5saQRKY&list=PLzK_rUGmc3o6EwPOCUCvBAbMJeYBS8PyY) for a flavor of the workshop.

**[Use this form to indicate your participation and submit talk proposals](https://goo.gl/forms/tUeBUY6uAnAo8v5m2)**
by **April 7th ~~March 15th~~**. There is no penalty for late sign-ups, but we may not be able to accommodate late talk proposals.

## Schedule

The schedule will be posted closer to the date of the workshop. We expect to have a mix of talks from participants and the core development team. Similarly to last year, the workshop will end with unstructured collaboration time to work on personal projects and brainstorm the future of JuMP.
