# The Second Annual JuMP-dev Workshop

June 27-29, 2018, at the Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux, University of Bordeaux.

## Travel support and late submissions

Thanks to the generous support of MIT Sloan School of Management, the JuMP-dev committee has funds available to provide travel support to a limited number of attendees. Given the late availability of this grant, we will also consider new submissions of talk proposals for those who declined to submit earlier because of lack of funding. Already-confirmed speakers are also welcome to request support, and will be considered on an equal basis with new submissions.

To apply, fill in [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/MJVDJBdkxTfD5hqf2).

**NOTE:** There will be a hard submission deadline of **May 15, 2018**. Notifications of any awards will be sent out by **June 1, 2018** (at the latest).

## Purpose

This workshop is a follow-up to the [first annual JuMP-dev workshop](/meetings/mit2017/) held in June 2017 at MIT. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together students, researchers, and practitioners with interests in the software aspects of [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) and related packages. Interest areas of the workshop include:

- JuMP core development ([MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl), JuMP 1.0)
- Mathematical optimization solvers written in Julia
- Automatic differentiation in Julia (ReverseDiffSparse, ...)
- Julia interfaces to solvers
- JuMP extensions (stochastic programming, robust optimization, multiobjective optimization, ...)
- Optimization libraries that use JuMP
- Significant uses of JuMP in applications
- JuMP for teaching
- Developer tools for JuMP

The JuMP-dev workshop is a great opportunity to meet other people working on and around JuMP, as well as to provide feedback to the core JuMP team concerning its future direction. The workshop is scheduled to lead into [ISMP](https://ismp2018.sciencesconf.org).

## Location

The workshop will be held at the [Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux, University of Bordeaux](https://goo.gl/maps/PaeJbcRC58K2). There are options to stay in Talence (walking distance to JuMP-dev), or the Bordeaux city centre (short tram ride).

A variety of information about Bordeaux, as well as how to get there, and possible accommodation options, is available on the [ISMP conference website](https://ismp2018.sciencesconf.org). 

## Call for participants

The workshop is open for anybody to attend. In particular, we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core development team.

The call for talks has now closed. However, if you wish to attend without giving a talk, **[use this form to indicate your participation](https://goo.gl/forms/tUeBUY6uAnAo8v5m2)**.

## Schedule

A preliminary schedule is outlined below. It will be updated once speakers are confirmed. The scheduled start of the workshop is at 13:00 on Wednesday, 27th June. This is to allow participants to arrive in Bordeaux on Wednesday morning.
