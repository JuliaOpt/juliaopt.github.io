# The Second Annual JuMP-dev Workshop

June 27-29, 2018, at the Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux, University of Bordeaux.

## Purpose

This workshop is a follow-up to the [first annual JuMP-dev workshop](/meetings/mit2017/) held in June 2017 at MIT. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together students, researchers, and practitioners with interests in the software aspects of the [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) "stack". Interest areas of the workshop include:

- JuMP core development ([MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl), JuMP 1.0)
- Mathematical optimization solvers written in Julia
- Julia interfaces to solvers
- JuMP extensions (stochastic programming, robust optimization, multiobjective optimization, ...)
- Optimization libraries that use JuMP
- JuMP for teaching
- Developer tools for JuMP

The JuMP-dev workshop is a great opportunity to meet other people working on and around JuMP, as well as to provide feedback to the core JuMP team concerning its future direction. The workshop is scheduled to lead into [ISMP](https://ismp2018.sciencesconf.org), which most of the core team will be attending.

## Location

The workshop will be held at the Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux, University of Bordeaux on the Thursday and Friday of the week prior to ISMP 2018 (i.e. June 28-29).

A variety of information about Bordeaux, as well as how to get there, and possible accommodation options, is available on the [ISMP conference website](https://ismp2018.sciencesconf.org).

## Call for participants

The workshop is open for anybody to attend. In particular, we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core development team.

Participants are encouraged but not required to give a 20-minute talk about their work that is related to JuMP. Talks should be aimed at a technical audience and demonstrate what you are using JuMP for, as well as the features that you like/dislike/have on your wishlist. See [last year's talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esOe5saQRKY&list=PLzK_rUGmc3o6EwPOCUCvBAbMJeYBS8PyY) for a flavor of the workshop.

Please contact jump-dev-committee@googlegroups.com if you would like to attend. Submissions are welcome until **March 15th**.

## Schedule

The schedule will be posted closer to the date of the workshop. We expect to have a mix of talks from participants and the core development team. Similarly to last year, the workshop will end with unstructured collaboration time to work on personal projects and brainstorm the future of JuMP.
