# The Third Annual JuMP-dev Workshop

March 13-14, 2019, Santiago, Chile.

This workshop is the third JuMP-dev workshop after the [first](/meetings/mit2017/)
and [second](/meetings/bordeaux2018/) JuMP-dev workshops.

## Purpose

The purpose of the workshop is to bring together students, researchers, and
practitioners with interests in the software aspects of
[JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) and related packages. Interest areas
of the workshop include:

- JuMP core development ([MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl), JuMP 1.0)
- Mathematical optimization solvers written in Julia
- Automatic differentiation in Julia (ReverseDiffSparse, ...)
- Julia interfaces to solvers
- JuMP extensions (stochastic programming, robust optimization, multiobjective optimization, ...)
- Optimization libraries that use JuMP
- Significant uses of JuMP in applications
- JuMP for teaching
- Developer tools for JuMP

The JuMP-dev workshop is a great opportunity to meet other people working on and
around JuMP, as well as to provide feedback to the core JuMP team concerning its
future direction.

## Location

The workshop will be held in Santiago, Chile. The exact venue details will be
released after talk acceptance.

## Call for participants

The workshop is open for anybody to attend. In particular, we invite new
contributors and those who have not met the core development team.

In addition to attending, participants are also invited to submit a proposal for
a short (~20-minute) talk. The committee is looking for talks that will start
off discussions during the workshop and beyond and for talks that present
developments that the community may not be aware of. Talks will optionally be
recorded and posted for those who cannot attend. We encourage speakers to give
direct feedback on JuMP.

and [JuMP-dev II](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6RJUxzYlWENcs9yf-CRoDvD)
for a flavor of the workshop.
