# The Third Annual JuMP-dev Workshop

March 12-14, 2019, Santiago, Chile.

This workshop is the third JuMP-dev workshop after the [first](/meetings/mit2017/)
and [second](/meetings/bordeaux2018/) JuMP-dev workshops.

**To register your (free!) attendance at the workshop, (and optionally submit a 
proposal for a talk), [use this form](https://goo.gl/forms/2nEljULHwC3zzcE13).**

## Outline

The purpose of the workshop is to bring together students,
researchers, and practitioners with interests in the software aspects of [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl)
and related packages. The workshop is open for anybody to attend. In particular,
we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core development team.

The workshop is structured as a three-day event. The first day will begin with a
series of hands-on tutorials by the core developers (ranging from no-experience
necessary, to advanced usages of JuMP). On the second and third days we will
have talks from participants in the morning and time for collaboration in the
afternoons.

Participants are invited to submit proposals for a short (~20-minute) talk on the
following topics:

- JuMP core development ([MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl), JuMP 1.0)
- Mathematical optimization solvers written in Julia 
- Automatic differentiation in Julia 
- Julia interfaces to solvers 
- JuMP extensions (stochastic programming, robust optimization, 
    multiobjective optimization, ...) 
- Optimization libraries that use JuMP 
- Significant uses of JuMP in applications 
- JuMP for teaching 
- Developer tools for JuMP

Talks should focus on the technical aspects related to JuMP, as opposed to
general interest talks. In particular, the committee is looking for talks that
will start off discussions during the workshop and beyond and for talks that
present developments that the community may not be aware of.

See the talks from [JuMP-dev I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esOe5saQRKY&list=PLzK_rUGmc3o6EwPOCUCvBAbMJeYBS8PyY)
and [JuMP-dev II](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6RJUxzYlWENcs9yf-CRoDvD)
for a flavor of the workshop.

**To register your attendance at the workshop, (and optionally submit a proposal

Talk proposals are also welcome until December 21st and talk acceptance will
be notified by January 4th.
